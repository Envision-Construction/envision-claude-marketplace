# Full Engagement Playbook — materials review / feasibility / indication-report critique

Use when the ask spans multiple specialist domains (e.g. "review these broker captive materials", "critique the indication report", "should we form, rent a cell, or stay conventional").

## 1. Gather (orchestrating session only)

- Retrieve source materials via envision-mcp (Gmail/Drive) **in the main session** — specialists never get gateway access.
- Save raw documents under a gitignored path (`memory/private/<engagement>-sources/`), one manifest file listing: filename, origin ID (Gmail msg / Drive file), date, one-line description, fetch status.
- Gotcha: `parse_document_on_demand` accepts only `gs://` URIs. The reliable path for email attachments is: `gmail_get_attachment` → save locally → native `Read` (PDF supported, use `pages`).
- Fold in internal context (prior memos, tax-counsel opinions, related memory files) by path.

## 2. Analyze (one parallel dispatch)

Dispatch all relevant specialists in a single message. Each prompt carries:
- The section assignment (e.g. tax agent → Regulatory; structures agent → Legal-structural + domicile matrix; coverage-counsel → program mechanics / premium-finance exposure).
- **Pointers**: manifest path + the specific local file paths it must Read. Never paste document bodies into prompts.
- An output path to Write its full section, and an instruction to return a distilled summary under 500 words.
- The reminder: two-source rule, pinpoint + URL + verified-on citations, indexed figures re-verified, not-found is an answer.

## 3. Synthesize (main session)

- Read the section files, reconcile conflicts (note where specialists disagree and why).
- Run `Skill(pe-executive:pe-executive-mindset)` for the Strategy section — value creation, cash/EBITDA impact, risk-adjusted comparison of the structural options, negotiation leverage with brokers.
- Author the recommendation memo: cites all sections + `references/current-legislation.md`; separates Regulatory / Legal / Strategy; ends with the counsel/actuary escalation line.
- Deliverables live in `memory/projects/<engagement>/` with a MEMORY.md index and a source-manifest; update the top-level memory index.
