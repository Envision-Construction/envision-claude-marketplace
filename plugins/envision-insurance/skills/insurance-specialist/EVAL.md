# insurance-specialist — Quantitative Evaluation (2026-07-04)

> Method: 12 keyed prompts (3 fabricated-authority traps, 3 stale-figure/currency traps, 3 domain-depth, 3 judgment) × 2 configs (with skill / without) × 3 repeat runs = 72 runs. Independent scorer agents graded 210 keyed-fact checks against an answer sheet derived from an adversarially verified corpus (deep-research, 104 agents, 3-vote verification), web-verified 350 extracted citations, and 24 blind order-swapped A/B judgments (judges never told which config produced which answer, instructed not to reward length). Workflow `wf_49589e16-c45`; full per-run data in the session workspace.

## Results

| Metric | With skill (36 runs) | Without skill (36 runs) |
|---|---|---|
| Keyed-fact pass rate | **100%** (105/105) | 92.4% (97/105) |
| Trap pass rate | **100%** (18/18) | 83.3% (15/18) |
| Fabrication rate (invented authority) | 0% | 0% |
| Citation validity (web-verified) | **100%** (180/180) | 98.8% (168/170) |
| Blind A/B wins | **20** | 4 (0 ties) |

## Reading the numbers honestly

- **Where the skill's edge concentrates: legal currency and regulation-content precision.** Every baseline trap failure was the same prompt (p05): all three baseline runs were unaware of the 2026 *Drake Plastics* vacatur of the listed-transaction reg — one asserted T.D. 10029 "remains in effect" and warned against relying on "a future vacatur." Both invalid baseline citations were content misstatements of the T.D. 10029 factor structure (stating either/or where the listed tier requires BOTH financing and sub-30% loss ratio). The skill's dated snapshot + never-quote-indexed-figures-from-memory rule eliminated this class entirely, 36/36.
- **What the skill does NOT add: gross-fabrication protection.** A frontier model with web access refused all three pure fabrication baits in both configs (0% fabrication everywhere). The skill's value is currency, precision, and consistency — not preventing invented statutes.
- **Blind preference 20–4** (binomial p ≈ 0.0008 vs. chance) on correctness/currency/usefulness criteria with length explicitly not rewarded.
- **Cost**: with-skill runs average roughly +90% wall-clock and +15% tokens (reference reading + verification passes). Iteration-1 smoke data: ~788s vs ~406s, ~171K vs ~150K tokens per run.
